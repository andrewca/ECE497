This directory contains project files for Homework 3 from ECE497 by Chris Andrews

Temp folder has the files that read from a temperature sensor over i2c

	tempSensor.c  --  top-level code, sets up temperature sensors, gpios

	gpio-int-test.c -- allows user to wait for logic 1 interrupt

	gpio-utils.c/h -- helper functions for gpio access

	myi2cget.c  --  allows C access to i2c devices
	i2c-dev.h -- helper functions for i2c access

	Makefile

Etch folder contains the code that interfaces with an i2c led matrix

	etchSketch_arm -- arm executable
	
	etch.c	-- code to interface gpio's with i2c device, holds LED map array
	
	gpio-utils.c/h - functions to simplify gpio interfacing
	i2c-dev.h & i2cbusses.c/h -- functions to interface with i2c devices
	
	Makefile
